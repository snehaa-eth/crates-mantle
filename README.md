## 🚀 About The Project

Crates is a **global investing platform** designed to simplify access to U.S. equities. We empower users in **India, Africa, LATAM, and Southeast Asia** to buy **real, fractional shares of U.S. stocks**.

Instead of navigating confusing tickers and charts, users invest in **curated themes**—called **Crates**—such as *“AI Leaders”* or *“Women-Led Enterprises.”*

Crates provides a **narrative-first investing experience**, helping investors connect with the **stories behind the companies** they back.

We also enable **creators and financial influencers** to build, share, and monetize their own Crates, fostering a **community-driven approach** to investing.

All of this is built on top of the **Dinari SDK**, which powers **Dstocks** and ensures:

- ✅ Compliance with government regulations  
- ✅ Full KYC implementation  
- ✅ Licensed infrastructure

This lets us focus on creating a **seamless and intuitive experience** for our users.
